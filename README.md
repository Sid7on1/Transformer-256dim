# *****Transformer-256dim*****
A powerful Transformer architecture built from scratch by Prajwal for sequence modeling tasks. This model captures complex patterns in data using multi-head self-attention, layer normalization, and feedforward networks. It’s ideal for NLP, classification, translation, and generative tasks.
# Transformer Architecture by Prajwal

This project implements a Transformer model from scratch using PyTorch, inspired by the original "Attention is All You Need" paper. It is designed to handle a wide range of sequence modeling tasks, such as text classification, language modeling, translation, and generative AI.

## 🚀 Features
- Multi-Head Self-Attention
- Positional Encoding
- Layer Normalization
- Feedforward Neural Network (FFN)
- Scalable for both encoder-only or encoder-decoder settings
- Highly modular and easy to extend

## 🧠 Model Overview
The Transformer uses self-attention to weigh input tokens dynamically based on their relevance. Each token attends to all others in a sequence, enabling deep context learning and long-range dependency capture.

## 🛠️ Installation
```bash
pip install torch numpy
